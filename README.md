# 📊 Amazon Sales Analysis Project

This project explores and analyzes sales data from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. It covers **data cleaning using SQL**, **exploratory data analysis using Python**, and a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize business insights.

---

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this project is to clean raw transactional sales data, extract meaningful insights through analysis, and visualize key business KPIs to support decision-making in sales, marketing, and operations.

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning (SQL)

Performed in **MySQL** using the script [`amazon_sales(mysql).sql`](https://github.com/AnkitPal24/Amazon-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/amazon_sales(mysql).sql):

- Checked duplicate rows based on `Order ID`
- Handled missing values in key columns like `Category`, `Customer Name`, `Payment Method`
- Standardized payment method values (e.g., 'cod' → 'COD')
- Converted order date string to SQL `DATE` format

Final cleaned dataset exported as: `amazon_sales_clean(sql).csv`

## 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

EDA performed using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to understand sales performance and customer behavior.
